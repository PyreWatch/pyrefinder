# Pyrefinder
*A realtime wilfdire detection and monitoring system*

## Getting started
To get started you will need the following
* Docker
* Python3 with pipenv installed

The steps to run the project are as follows:
1. In the terminal within the project directory run `pipenv shell && pipenv install --dev` to install all the dependencies
2. To then start the HiveMQ/Mosquitto broker run either `docker run -d -p 1883:1883 -p 1884:1884 -v {:project_root}/component-configs/mosquitto.conf:/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf eclipse-mosquitto` or `docker run -d -p 1883:1883 -p 1884:1884 -v {:project_root}/component-configs/config.xml:/opt/hivemq/conf/config.xml --name hivemq hivemq/hivemq-ce` where the project_root is the absolute path to the project
3. Once the MQTT broker is running, launch pyrefinder with `python -m pyrefinder.main` and it should say "Connected" in the terminal

And now youre ready to to accept incoming connections and act appropriatley based of the topic.

# Database
Currently, our system utilizes SQLite for the database so that we can easily set up our system and get started developing accross all team member machines, but due to the inherent short commings of using a single file based database for a system that would have many concurrent writing connections, the goal would be to change over to a more robust database. The database in this case would be TimescaleDB, a time series extension of Postgres. The reason TimescaleDB was chosen was because it would allow us to have the time series performance in order to log our incoming data while utilizing the power of relations, updates and pure SQL to keep track of our fighters.

# Image Storage
Another aspect to our storage system is that we store our incoming images based off the type of image they are. If fire/smoke is detected in an image, the incoming message is stored in images/fire, using the client_id and the time to create unique files. If no fire was detected, then the image is stored in images,nofire. This done so that the images are pre split and could be used both for evaluation and auditing of the system and furture training. But in order to link the staus/picture update with the fighters in the database, we usitilsze triggers and update statments to make sure that if a new status comes in, the last type of status and time is auto updated in the fighters table and the image path is then updated for the fighter as well, so that images do not congets the database.
